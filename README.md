# 🛰 Satellite Network Simulator 1 (SatNetSim1)

**SatNetSim1** is a **Handover Simulator** built on the [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/) discrete-event simulation framework in Python.  
It is designed to model **handover scenarios in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks** with high flexibility and detailed performance metrics.  

> ⚠️ **Note:** This simulator is currently under active development and **has not been officially published**.  
> It is a **non-open-source** project — usage is strictly limited.
